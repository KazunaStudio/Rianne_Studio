                        <p>
                            Did you know, according to the World Health Organization, more than 5% of people worldwide, around 430 million, 
                            deal with hearing loss? And get this, it shoots up to a whopping 25% for the older folks. 
                            It's kind of heart-wrenching, isn't it? 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I mean, imagine being in a chat and missing out on 
                            crucial info just because of hearing lossâ€”it's like skipping a beat in the conversation. 
                            What hits home is, that it's not just the profound cases; even folks with milder issues face 
                            this safety challenge.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Picture this: trying to stay alert in a world that's not playing the full soundtrack. 
                            It's a real universal struggle, from mild to profound hearing loss.
                        </p>
                        <p>And so we decided we would like to help these individuals.</p>

                                I began the design exercise with a focused brainstorming session to capture initial thoughts. Prior to research, 
                                I outlined key insights needed from potential users, this included:

                            </p>

                            <p>
                                To gather essential information, I designed a Google Forms questionnaire aimed at reaching a broad audience 
                                with hearing disabilities. The use of anonymous responses facilitated quick feedback, helping me assess 
                                the effectiveness of my questions in capturing valuable insights.

                                I conducted in-depth research online, explor ing news articles and government publications to enhance my

                        <p>
                            To address challenges associated with hearing loss, spanning from mild to profound, and insightful 
                            discussions, my team and I chose to develop an empowering app. This app offers real-time transcription of 
                            spoken words, visual alerts for crucial sounds, and environmental cue recognition. It also facilitates seamless 
                            communication with features like text messaging and video calling.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The app's inclusive design also encourages community engagement and ultimately enhances their independence and overall quality 
                            of life.

                        <h5 className='subheader'>Designing HearMe</h5>
                        <p>Collaborating with our lecturer and team members proved instrumental in refining the app's design. Ultimately, 
                            we unanimously agreed to proceed with a streamlined yet user-friendly interface for the application.

                        <p>
                            We opted for a minimalist approach, incorporating basic and straightforward icons complemented by a 
                            soothing blue-grey color scheme.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The primary features include:

                        <h6>Noise Dectection</h6>
                        <p>
                            The noise detection feature for people with mild to profound deafness utilizes advanced audio recognition for 
                            customized or automatic alerts, enhancing situational awareness and inclusivity.

                        <h6>Captioning Service</h6>
                        <p>
                            Along with our noise detection feature, we've incorporated an integrated captioning service for calls 
                            in our communication platform. This guarantees real-time, text-based representation of spoken dialogue,
                            significantly elevating inclusivity and accessibility.

                            Reflecting on the project my team and I undertook, I've gathered some key insights:
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    Avoid assumptions: Validating assumptions is crucial. User issues may differ from our initial 
                                    perceptions, emphasizing the need for continuous validation.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Data-driven UX: Utilizing user research data to prioritize needs and pinpoint pain points greatly simplifies the 
                                    visual design process
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Balance Research and Design: Striking equilibrium between thorough research and actual visual design is
